# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohammad Noorchenarboo

🎯 **Biostatistician | Senior Data Scientist | AI Researcher**  
🔬 Focused on advancing healthcare with AI, data science, and statistical genetics.

## 🧠 About Me

I am a Medical Statistician and Data Scientist specializing in the application of **machine learning**, **statistical modeling**, and **bioinformatics** to healthcare and genomics.  
I combine **deep expertise in biostatistics** with **advanced computational techniques** to drive research and real-world evidence (RWE) solutions.

With a strong foundation in **predictive modeling**, **GWAS**, **clinical trial analysis**, and **explainable AI**, I aim to bridge the gap between medical research and intelligent data-driven insights.
